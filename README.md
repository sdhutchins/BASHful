<h1> BASHful</h1>

These scripts don't say much, but they get the job done!</center>

## Installation

Install all scripts by downloading the `download_all.sh` script and running it in your bash shell.

Here's an example of how to do this on your command line.

```bash
wget https://github.com/sdhutchins/BASHful/blob/master/download_all.sh
chmod +x download_all.sh
download_all.sh
```
