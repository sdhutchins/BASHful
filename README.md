These scripts don't say much, but they get the job done!

## Installation

Install all scripts by downloading the `download_all.sh` script and running it in your bash shell.

Here's an example of how to do this on your command line:

```bash
# Download the raw script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdhutchins/BASHful/main/download_all.sh

# Make it executable
chmod +x download_all.sh

# Run the installer
./download_all.sh
```

## Scripts Included

- `cbproj`: Create standard computational biology project structures.
- `doc2md`: Batch convert documents (PDF, DOCX, etc.) to Markdown.
- `rmdsstore`: Recursively delete `.DS_Store` files.
- `extract-pdfs`: Collect all PDFs from subdirectories into one folder.
